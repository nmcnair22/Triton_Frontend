# Backend Structure Document

This document explains the backend setup for the Triton-v3 project in clear, everyday language. By the end, you’ll understand how the server, database, APIs, hosting, and all supporting pieces fit together.

## 1. Backend Architecture

### Overall Design
- We use **Laravel**, a popular PHP framework, organized around the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern.  
- Business logic lives in **Service** classes, data access is handled by **Repository** classes, and Laravel’s built-in **Eloquent ORM** ties models to database tables.  
- We follow SOLID principles and PSR-12 coding standards to keep code clean and maintainable.

### Scalability, Maintainability & Performance
- **Docker containers** let us spin up multiple copies of the app behind a load balancer, so we can handle more users by simply adding more containers.  
- **Caching** with Redis or Memcached speeds up repeat data fetches (e.g., common dashboard queries).  
- **Queues** (powered by Laravel Queues and Redis or AWS SQS) offload long-running tasks like sending emails or generating PDFs.  
- A clear folder structure (Controllers, Services, Repositories, Models) makes it easy for new developers to jump in.

### Key Frameworks & Libraries (Tech Stack)
- **Laravel (PHP 8.x)** for core server logic  
- **Eloquent ORM** for database modeling  
- **Redis** for caching and queues  
- **MySQL** (or Amazon Aurora MySQL) for relational data  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Nginx** or **Apache** as the web server

## 2. Database Management

- We use a **relational database** (MySQL) to store structured data like users, products, orders, and permissions.  
- **Eloquent Migrations** track all schema changes in version control—no manual database edits.  
- **Seeders** populate common data (e.g., default roles and permissions) when setting up a new environment.  
- Routine **backups** (daily snapshots) and **point-in-time recovery** keep data safe.  
- **Read replicas** can be added to distribute heavy read traffic, improving performance.

## 3. Database Schema

Below is a human-readable view of the main tables. You can adapt these to SQL migration files as needed.

### Core Tables
- **users**: Stores user accounts (id, name, email, password hash, active status, timestamps).
- **roles**: Defines roles like Admin, Editor, Customer (id, name, description, timestamps).
- **permissions**: Lists granular actions (id, name, group, description, timestamps).
- **role_user**: Links users to roles (user_id, role_id).
- **permission_role**: Links roles to permissions (permission_id, role_id).

### Business Tables
- **products**: E-commerce items (id, name, description, price, stock, timestamps).
- **orders**: Customer orders (id, user_id, total_amount, status, timestamps).
- **order_items**: Items in each order (id, order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price).
- **invoices**: Billing documents (id, order_id or user_id, template_id, pdf_url, status, timestamps).
- **invoice_templates**: Predefined layouts (id, name, html_template, timestamps).

### Content & App Modules
- **posts**: Blog entries (id, user_id, title, body_html, published_at, timestamps).
- **files**: Uploaded files (id, user_id, filename, storage_path, size, mime_type, timestamps).
- **messages**: Chat messages (id, sender_id, recipient_id or room_id, body, timestamps).
- **tasks**: To-dos (id, user_id, title, details, due_date, completed_at, timestamps).
- **mails**: Internal mail client data (id, user_id, folder, subject, body, read_flag, timestamps).

### SQL Example (MySQL)
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
-- Similar CREATE TABLE statements exist for roles, permissions, and pivot tables
```  
(You can generate full migrations via Laravel’s artisan commands.)

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

We expose a **RESTful JSON API**. Key points:

- All endpoints are under `/api/v1/`.
- Authentication uses **Laravel Sanctum** tokens, sent in an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- We follow HTTP verbs: `GET` to read, `POST` to create, `PUT/PATCH` to update, `DELETE` to remove.

### Authentication
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — user login, returns token  
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` — new account signup  
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` — revoke token  
- `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password` — initiate reset  
- `POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password` — complete reset

### User & Role Management
- `GET /api/v1/users` — list users  
- `POST /api/v1/users` — create user  
- `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` — update user  
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}` — delete user
- `GET /api/v1/roles` — list roles  
- `GET /api/v1/permissions` — list permissions

### E-commerce
- `GET /api/v1/products` — product catalog  
- `POST /api/v1/orders` — place an order  
- `GET /api/v1/orders/{id}` — view order details

### Content Modules
- `GET /api/v1/posts` — list blog posts  
- `POST /api/v1/posts` — create a post  
- `GET /api/v1/posts/{id}` — view a post
- Similar endpoints exist for files, tasks, messages, mails, invoices

## 5. Hosting Solutions

- **Dockerized Laravel** app deployed to **cloud servers** (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplets, or AWS ECS).  
- **MySQL** runs on managed services (Amazon RDS or Azure Database) for high availability and automated backups.  
- **Object Storage**: Amazon S3 (or equivalent) holds uploads and generated PDFs.  
- **CDN** (CloudFront, Fastly) caches static assets and media for low-latency delivery worldwide.

**Why this setup?**  
- Managed databases free us from patching and backups.  
- Containers ensure consistent environments from development through production.  
- CDNs and global edge nodes speed up asset delivery.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Load Balancer** (AWS ELB or Nginx) evenly distributes web traffic across app servers.  
- **Cache Layer** (Redis or Memcached) sits between the app and database, serving repeat queries in milliseconds.  
- **Queue Worker Pool** processes background jobs (emails, PDF generation) without slowing down web requests.  
- **Content Delivery Network** (CloudFront) accelerates static file delivery.  
- **Logging & Aggregation**: Logs collected by **Monolog**, shipped to **CloudWatch**, **ELK Stack**, or **Papertrail**.

These pieces work together to provide fast, reliable service even under heavy load.

## 7. Security Measures

- **HTTPS/TLS** enforced across all endpoints.  
- **Authentication** via Laravel Sanctum or JWT with rotating tokens.  
- **Authorization** enforced server-side with Laravel **Policies & Gates**, matching the frontend `PermissionGuard`.  
- **CSRF Protection** built into Laravel’s middleware.  
- **Input Validation & Sanitization** in controllers and form requests.  
- **Encryption at Rest** for sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens) and **encryption in transit** via TLS.  
- Regular **dependency audits** and **security patching**.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Uptime & Metrics**: AWS CloudWatch or New Relic tracks CPU, memory, response times, error rates.  
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry captures exceptions and stack traces in real time.  
- **Log Monitoring**: Aggregated logs in ELK Stack or Papertrail help diagnose issues.  
- **Automated Backups**: Daily database snapshots and weekly full-server backups.  
- **Health Checks**: Endpoint `/health` to verify database, cache, and disk availability.  
- **Regular Updates**: Dependabot or equivalent keeps libraries current; quarterly audits review security.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The Triton-v3 backend is a modern, containerized Laravel application sitting on a reliable MySQL database. It employs RESTful APIs, Redis caching, background queues, and a global CDN to deliver a fast, secure user experience. Role-based access control is enforced both server- and client-side, ensuring that users can only see and do what they’re allowed. Automated monitoring, logging, and backups keep the system healthy and maintainable. This setup balances performance, security, and cost, ready to grow with your users’ needs.
