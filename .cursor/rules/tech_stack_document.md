# Triton-v3 Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices behind the Triton-v3 project in everyday terms. You don’t need a technical background to understand why we picked each tool and how they fit together.

## Frontend Technologies

We built the user interface with modern, high-performance tools that make development faster and the app more responsive:

*   **Vue.js 3.x**: A user-friendly JavaScript framework for building interactive web pages. It keeps code organized and easy to maintain.

*   **Vite**: A lightning-fast development server and build tool. It lets developers see changes instantly and produces optimized code for production.

*   **PrimeVue UI Library**: A rich set of pre-built components (buttons, tables, menus, dialogs, etc.) that give the app a consistent, professional look with minimal effort.

*   **Pinia**: A simple, predictable way to manage the app’s data (state). It ensures that information like user settings or shopping cart contents stays in sync across the app.

*   **Vue Router**: Handles in-page navigation so users can move between dashboards, apps, and pages without full page reloads.

*   **Axios**: A lightweight tool for sending and receiving data from our backend server. It powers features like login, data fetching for dashboards, and form submissions.

*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first styling framework that makes it quick to design responsive layouts and custom themes (light/dark) without writing lots of custom CSS.

*   **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor that allows more organized styling through variables, nesting, and reusable snippets.

*   **Chart.js**: The library behind all interactive charts and graphs in dashboards and reporting views.

*   **Quill**: A rich text editor used in blog and document-creation interfaces.

*   **Additional Styling & Form Plugins**:

    *   `@primeuix/themes` and `tailwindcss-primeui` for PrimeVue theme integration
    *   `@primevue/forms` for enhanced form handling
    *   `primeicons` for consistent iconography

*   **Utility Libraries**:

    *   **xlsx**: Read/write Excel files in browser-based invoice and reporting features
    *   **zod**: Schema validation for ensuring data from forms or APIs meets expected formats before it’s used

These tools combine to create a fast, responsive, and visually consistent user experience across different devices.

## Backend Technologies

Our backend powers data storage, authentication, and business logic behind the scenes:

*   **Laravel (PHP Framework)**: A mature, well-documented framework that structures server-side code, routing, and database interactions. It speeds up development with built-in features for authentication, caching, and more.

*   **MySQL**: A reliable relational database for storing user accounts, permissions, invoices, product data, and other structured information.

*   **REST API**: A standardized way for the frontend to send and receive data (JSON) to/from the backend. All operations—login, data retrieval, create/update/delete—happen through these API endpoints.

*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:

    *   Implemented in Laravel via Policies/Gates and mirrored on the frontend with a custom `PermissionGuard` component
    *   Ensures users see only the routes and UI actions they’re allowed to perform

*   **Authentication Service**:

    *   Handles secure login, registration, password reset, and session/token management
    *   Protects endpoints with token-based or session-based authentication (e.g., Laravel Sanctum)

Together, these components ensure data integrity, secure access, and smooth communication between client and server.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

We set up a robust foundation for hosting, version control, and automated releases:

*   **Version Control: Git & GitHub**

    *   All source code is tracked in a Git repository hosted on GitHub
    *   Collaborative development with pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking

*   **CI/CD: GitHub Actions**

    *   Automated workflows run tests, linters, and build steps on every code push
    *   Successful builds are automatically deployed to staging or production environments

*   **Hosting**:

    *   **Frontend**: Static files (HTML, CSS, JS) served via a CDN or specialized host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3 + CloudFront)
    *   **Backend**: Dockerized Laravel app running on cloud servers (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.) behind Nginx or Apache

*   **Environment Management**:

    *   Environment variables (`.env` files) store sensitive settings (API keys, database credentials)
    *   GitHub Secrets protect these values in CI/CD pipelines

This setup provides:

*   **Reliability**: Automated tests catch errors early
*   **Scalability**: Containers and CDNs grow with user demand
*   **Easy Deployment**: One-click or automatic releases on code merge

## Third-Party Integrations

While most functionality is built in-house, we leverage a few key libraries to extend the app’s capabilities:

*   **Chart.js**: For interactive charts in dashboards and report views
*   **Quill**: For rich text editing in blog posts and document templates
*   **xlsx**: For generating and reading Excel files in invoicing and reporting
*   **zod**: For runtime data validation of user input and API responses

These integrations let us focus on core features while reusing battle-tested solutions for specialized tasks.

## Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve incorporated multiple layers of protection and optimization:

*   **Authentication & Authorization**:

    *   Secure token/session storage and CSRF protection
    *   Role-based access control on both frontend (`PermissionGuard`) and backend (Laravel Policies/Gates)

*   **Data Protection**:

    *   HTTPS enforced in all environments
    *   Input validation with Zod and Laravel request validation
    *   Database sanitization to prevent SQL injection

*   **Performance Optimizations**:

    *   **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**: Vite splits code by route, loading only what’s needed
    *   **Caching**: API responses and database queries cached where appropriate
    *   **Asset Minification & Compression**: CSS/JS files are minified and served with gzip or Brotli
    *   **Responsive Images & CDN Delivery**: Static assets delivered from edge nodes for low latency

These measures ensure a smooth, secure experience for all users.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Triton-v3 combines best-in-class technologies to meet its rich feature set and performance goals:

*   **Frontend**: Vue.js + Vite + PrimeVue + Tailwind CSS deliver a modern, responsive UI
*   **Backend**: Laravel + MySQL + REST API provide robust data handling and secure business logic
*   **Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions, Docker, and cloud hosting ensure reliable, scalable deployment
*   **Security & Performance**: RBAC, HTTPS, input validation, and build optimizations keep the app fast and safe

By choosing these technologies, we strike a balance between developer productivity, user experience, and operational reliability—ensuring Triton-v3 is maintainable today and ready to grow tomorrow.
