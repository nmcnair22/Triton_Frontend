``# Project Requirements Document ## 1. Project Overview Triton-v3 is a Vite-powered Vue.js 3 web application template that brings together dashboards, admin tools, e-commerce flows, content apps, accounting modules and a marketing landing page — all under one roof. By using PrimeVue UI components, Pinia for state management and Axios for HTTP requests, it offers a plug-and-play foundation that teams can extend rather than building dozens of screens from scratch. A built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system ensures that users only see the routes and UI elements they’re allowed to interact with. We’re building Triton-v3 to accelerate development of SaaS admin panels and internal tools. Instead of spending weeks wiring up login, permissions, charts, forms, tables and e-commerce checkout, developers plug into this template and immediately focus on business logic. Success will look like: (1) a working template that covers 80% of common admin needs, (2) clean separation of concerns so modules can be swapped or extended, (3) sub-100ms page transitions and sub-200kb initial payload on modern browsers. --- ## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope ### In-Scope (Version 1.0) - **Authentication & Authorization** • Login, registration, forgot-password, lock-screen flows • Custom `PermissionGuard` + Auth service enforcing RBAC - **Dashboards** • Marketing dashboard (traffic, conversions) • Banking dashboard (balances, transactions) - **Applications Suite** • Blog (list, view, edit) • File manager (upload, folder tree, download) • Chat interface (message list, send) • Task list (create, assign, complete) • Mail client (inbox, folders, compose, read) - **UI Kit** • PrimeVue forms, buttons, tables, lists, trees, overlays, charts, timelines - **E-commerce** • Product catalog, product creation form • Shopping cart, checkout wizard • Order history page - **User Management** • CRUD for users and roles • Permission assignments per role - **Landing Pages** • Features, pricing, contact sections - **Accounting & Reporting** • Invoice CRUD, template-based document generation, PDF download • Chart.js report manager - **Theming & Layouts** • Light/dark mode toggle • Main, auth, landing page layouts - **Core Infrastructure** • Client-side routing (Vue Router) • State management (Pinia) • API layer (Axios) • Responsive design (Tailwind CSS + Sass) ### Out-of-Scope (Phase 2+) - Real-time websockets or push notifications - Offline / PWA support - Third-party payment integrations (Stripe, PayPal) - Multi-tenant sub-domain architecture - GraphQL API support - Mobile-native wrappers (React Native / Capacitor) - Advanced analytics beyond basic Chart.js reports --- ## 3. User Flow When a **new visitor** lands on the root URL (`/`), they see the marketing landing page with feature highlights, pricing tiers and a contact section. If they navigate to a protected route or click “Log In,” they’re taken to `/auth/login`. From there they can log in, register a new account or recover their password. Once authenticated, they land on their default dashboard (marketing or banking) based on their role. An **authenticated user** sees a sidebar with navigation groups: Dashboards, Applications, E-commerce, User Management (if permitted), Accounting & Reporting, UI Kit. Clicking an item loads the corresponding view in the main content area. Permission checks run before each route—if access is denied, they are redirected or shown a “Not Authorized” message. Users can switch theme modes, update their profile via `/profile`, generate invoices, manage products or users, and log out from the top-right menu. Admins dive into the User Management section to add/edit roles and assign permissions, while regular users work only within their allowed modules. --- ## 4. Core Features - **Authentication & RBAC** • Email/password login, registration, forgot password, lock screen • `PermissionGuard` enforces route and UI element visibility - **Marketing & Banking Dashboards** • Interactive charts (Chart.js), numeric widgets, data tables - **Applications** • Blog: list, view, edit posts with WYSIWYG (Quill) • Files: folder tree, upload/download, Excel import/export (xlsx) • Chat: send/receive messages in real time (polling) • Tasks: create, assign, mark complete with due dates • Mail: inbox, sent, spam, trash, compose, detail - **UI Kit Components** • Forms, inputs, buttons, tables, lists, trees, overlays, menus, toasts - **E-commerce Module** • Product catalog, creation form, image upload • Shopping cart management, checkout steps • Order history, status tracking - **User & Role Management** • CRUD for users and roles, permission matrix UI - **Landing Pages** • Feature showcase, pricing tables, contact form - **Accounting & Reporting** • Invoice CRUD, PDF generation, preview, download • Data visualization in report manager - **Theming & Responsiveness** • Light/dark mode, mobile-friendly layout --- ## 5. Tech Stack & Tools - **Frontend** • Vue.js 3.x (Composition API) + Vite • PrimeVue component library + primeicons • Pinia for global state • Vue Router for navigation • Axios for API calls • Tailwind CSS + Sass for styling • Chart.js for charts • Quill rich-text editor • xlsx for Excel processing • zod for schema validation - **Backend (Inferred)** • Laravel (PHP) with MySQL (REST API, JWT or Sanctum for auth) - **IDE & Plugins** • Cursor (AI-powered IDE for code suggestions) - **AI Models (if any)** • None at V1 (all business logic lives in code + backend) --- ## 6. Non-Functional Requirements - **Performance** • Initial bundle < 200 KB gzipped • Route switch < 100 ms on modern browsers • API calls ideally < 500 ms - **Security** • Protect against XSS, CSRF, injection • Enforce HTTPS everywhere • Strict RBAC checks client-side and server-side - **Accessibility & Compliance** • WCAG AA compliance for core flows • GDPR-ready user data handling - **Usability** • Mobile-first responsive design • Clear error messages and toast notifications - **Maintainability** • Modular folder structure, clear naming conventions • Unit test hooks for critical components --- ## 7. Constraints & Assumptions - The backend API with auth and data endpoints is available and follows REST conventions. - Authentication uses JWT tokens or Laravel Sanctum cookies. - Modern evergreen browsers only (no IE11). - No server-side rendering (CSR only). - Cursor IDE integration is optional but recommended for developer productivity. - Chart.js is sufficient for initial reporting needs. --- ## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls - **Bundle Size Drift** • Mitigation: lazy-load routes, code-split large libraries (e.g., Quill). - **Permission Cache Staleness** • Mitigation: refresh permissions after role/user updates, use watchers in Pinia. - **API Rate Limits** • Mitigation: add basic retry with exponential backoff for key endpoints. - **Chart Re-render Overhead** • Mitigation: debounce data updates, reuse chart instances. - **Sass & Tailwind Conflicts** • Mitigation: enforce naming conventions, scope component styles. - **UX Edge Cases** • Mitigation: manual QA flows for permission denial, empty-state screens. --- *This document is the single source of truth for AI-driven generation of all subsequent technical artifacts: Tech Stack docs, Frontend Guidelines, Backend Structure, Security Guidelines and IDE rules.*``
